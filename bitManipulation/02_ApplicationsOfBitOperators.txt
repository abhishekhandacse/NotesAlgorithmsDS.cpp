
Applications of BitWise operators


1) They are widely used in areas of graphics ,specially XOR(Exclusive OR) operations.

2) They are widely used in the embedded systems, in situations, where we need to set/clear/toggle just one single bit of a specific register without modifying the other contents. We can do OR/AND/XOR operations with the appropriate mask for the bit position.

3) Data structure like n-bit map can be used to allocate n-size resource pool to represent the current status.

4) Bits are used in networking, framing the packets of numerous bits which is sent to another system generally through any type of serial interface.
